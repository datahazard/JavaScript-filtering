# JavaScript Array Methods
A small project to learn how to work with [JavaScript Array Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).
As you can see in filter.js file, all the code is written using ES6 syntax.

If you want to try it out, in you terminal run `npm install` and `npm run dev-server`.
